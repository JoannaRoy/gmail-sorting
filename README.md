# gmail-sorting

This is a simple chrome extension I made to help me keep my inbox clean

## Why I made this

Every weekend, I sort my emails into folders but I find it annoying to `filter -> select -> right click -> move to -> label name` for each of the messages, especially since:

- they are usually from the same senders each week
- often messages that I want to save for my records but might not actually need to read thru / open every time (eg. a recurring receipt, or a newsletter that I don't want cluttering up my inbox but that I will perus thru later)
- as far as I can tell, gmail offers a way to automatically 'label' messages, but not a way to automatically 'move' them to the mailbox I want them in
- also, even if gmail can/could move the messages automatically, I still like to have them in my inbox to start so that I can see them / be reminded that I'm receiving them (eg. if its a subscription payment, I don't want to automatically have that filtered into a mailbox since then I might forget about it and end up paying for things unnecessarily. instead, I want to see it in my inbox, but still have a way to sort it _easily_ into a sub-mailbox for safekeeping)

I also made this because I wanted to learn more about making my own chrome extensions.

## How it works

It's not public (yet? maybe not ever haha. this was mostly for me but lets see)

I go to gmail and I click on the little folder sorter icon:

Then when I want to specify options, I go to the options page:

And when I want to sort, I just click on the clean up inbox option:
